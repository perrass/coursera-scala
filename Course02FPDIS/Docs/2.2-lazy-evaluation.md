### Structural Induction on Trees

Structural induction (结构归纳法) is not limited to lists, it applies to any tree structure

The general induction principle is the following:

To prove a property `P(t)` for all trees `t` of a certain type

* show that `P(l)` holds for all leaves `l` of a tree
* for each type of internal node `t` with subtrees $s_1$, ...,$s_n$ show that P($s_1$)^...^P($s_n$) implies `P(t)`

---

The Laws of IntSet:

For any set `s`, and elements `x` and `y`:

* `Empty contains x` = `false`
* `(s incl x) contains x` = `true`
* `(s incl x) contains y` = `s contains y` if `x != y`
* `(xs union ys) contains z` = `xs contains z || ys contains z`

### Streams

To find the second prime, there exists two methods:

**Collection**

	def isPrime(n: Int): Boolean = {
	    val sqrtN = Math.sqrt(n).asInstanceOf[Int]
	    (2 until sqrtN) forall (x => n % x != 0)
	}

	def secondPrime(n1: Int, n2: Int): Int = {
	    assert (n2 >= n1)
	    ((n1 to n2) filter isPrime)(1)
	}

**Recursion**

	def secondPrime2(from: Int, to: Int) =
	  nthPrime(from, to, 2)

	def nthPrime(from: Int, to: Int, n: Int): Int = {
	  if (from >= to) throw new Error("no prime")
	  else if (isPrime(from))
	    if (n == 1) from else nthPrime(from + 1, to, n - 1)
	  else nthPrime(from + 1, to, n)
	}

The first method is more elegant, but is less **efficient** dut to filter for all elems in collection.

**For avoiding computing the tail of a sequence until it is needed for the evaluation result**, we implement a new class `Stream`

* `Stream.empty`, `Stream.cons`
* `val xs = Stream.cons(1, Stream.coms(2, Stream.empty))`
* `toStream` method on a collection `(1 to 1000) toStream`

		def streamRange(lo: Int, hi: Int): Stream[Int] =
			if (lo >= hi) Stream.empty
			else Stream.cons(lo, streamRange(lo + 1, hi))

* `x #:: xs` == `Stream.cons(x, xs)`

A first draft

		trait Stream[+A] extends Seq[A]{
		  def isEmpty: Boolean
		  def head: A
		  def tail: Stream[A]
		}
		// tl: => Stream[T] means value by name, but by value
		object Stream{
		  def cons[T](hd: T, tl: => Stream[T]) = new Stream[T] {
		    override def isEmpty = false
		    override def head = hd
		    override def tail = tl
		  }

		  val empty = new Stream[Nothing] {
		    override def isEmpty = true
		    override def head = throw new NoSuchElementException("empty.head")
		    override def tail = throw new NoSuchElementException("empty.tail")
		  }
		}

		// tail is evaluate by name, it will return a value when tail.filter triggled
		// So the function is stopped
		class Stream[+T] {
			def filter(p: T => Boolean): Stream[T] =
				if (isEmpty) this
				else if (p(head)) cons(head, tail.filter(p))
				else tail.filter(p)
		}

### Lazy Evaluation

If tail is called several times, the corresponding stream will be recomputed each time. And the problem can be avoided by **storing the result of the first evaluation of tail and re-using the stored result**. This is applicable in purely functional language due to **an expression producing the same result each time it is evaluated**. This is lazy evaluation
