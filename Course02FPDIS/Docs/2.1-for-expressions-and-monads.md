2.1 For expression and monads

### Functions and Pattern Matching

### Collections

### Queries with For

For duplicates, `Set` is much better than `List`

### Translation of For

The syntax of `for` is closely related to the higher-order functions `map`, `flatMap` and `filter`

	def mapFun[T, U](xs: List[T], f: T => U): List[U] = 
		for (x <- xs) yield f(x)
		
	def flatMap[T, U](xs: List[T], f: T => Iterable[U]): List[U] =
		for (x <- xs; y <- f(x)) yield y
		
	def filter[T](xs: List[T], p: T => Boolean): List[T] = 
		for (x <- xs if p(x)) yield x
		
In reality, the Scala compiler expresses for-expressions in terms of `map`, `flatMap` and a lazy variant of `filter`

**E.g**

	for (x <- e1) yield e2
	
	e1.map(x => e2)
	
	for (x <- e1 if f; s) yield e2
	
	for (x <- e1.withFilter(x => f); s) yield e2
	
	for (x <- e1; y <- e2) yield e3
	
	e1.flatMap(x => for (y <- e2) yield e3)
	
	for {
		i <- 1 until n
		j <- 1 until i
		if isPrime(i + j)
	} yield (i, j)
	
	(1 until n).flatMap(i =>
		(1 until i).withFilter(j => isPrime(i+j))
			.map(j => (i, j)))

### Functional Random Generators

### Monads

In fact there's a name that describe this class of a data structures together with some algebraic laws that they should have. **They are called monads**

A monad M is a parametric type M[T] with two operations, `flatMap`(or `bind`) and `unit`

	trait M[T] {
		def flatMap[U](f: T => M[U]): M[U]
	}
	
	def unit[T](x: T): M[T]
	
* List is a monad with `unit(x) = List(x)`
* Set is monad with `unit(x) = Set(x)`
* Option is a monad with `unit(x) = Some(x)`
* Generator is a monad with `unit(x) = single(x)`

Then, how to define `map`

	m map f = m flatMap (x => unit(f(x)))
	m map f = m flatMap (x andThen unit)
	
**Monads Law**

1. associativity: `m flatMap f flatMap g = m flatMap (x => f(x) flatMap g)`
2. left unit: `unit(x) flatMap f = f(x)`
3. right unit: `m flatMap unit = m`
