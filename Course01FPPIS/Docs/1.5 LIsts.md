### More Functions on Lists

* xs.length: length
* xs.last: the last elem with exception if xs is empty
* xs.init: all elem except the last one, exception if xs is empty
* xs take n: the first n elems
* xs drop n: the rest of the collection after taking n elems
* xs(n): index at n

---

**creating new lists**

* ++, ::: (n)
* xs.reverse (**n^2**)
* xs updated (n, x): the same elements except at index n

**finding elements**

* xs indexOf x: return the index
* xs contains x

---

`xs ::: ys` = `ys. :::(xs)`, `.:::(xs)` means prepend xs, hence function pattern should match xs

	def concat[T](xs: List[T], ys: List[T]) =
