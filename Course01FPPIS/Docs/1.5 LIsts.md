1.5 Lists

### More Functions on Lists

* xs.length: length
* xs.last: the last elem with exception if xs is empty
* xs.init: all elem except the last one, exception if xs is empty
* xs take n: the first n elems
* xs drop n: the rest of the collection after taking n elems
* xs(n): index at n

---

**creating new lists**

* ++, ::: (n)
* xs.reverse (**n^2**)
* xs updated (n, x): the same elements except at index n

**finding elements**

* xs indexOf x: return the index
* xs contains x

---

`xs ::: ys` = `ys. :::(xs)`, `.:::(xs)` means prepend xs, hence function pattern should match xs

	def concat[T](xs: List[T], ys: List[T]) = 

### Pairs and Tuples

**merge sort**

Using Tuples for pattern matching

### Implicit Parameters

Parameterize types and Make a function for generalized types 

`scala.math.Ordering[T]` is the standard ordering library

**Rules for implicit parameters**

* is marked `implicit`
* has a type compatible with T
* is visible at the point of the function call, or is defined in a companion object associated with `T`.

### Higher-Order List Functions

**Map**

	abstract class List[T] {
		def map[U](f: T => U): List[U] = this match {
			case Nil => this
			case x :: xs.map(f)
		}
		
		def filter(p: T => Boolean): List[T] = this match {
			case Nil => this
			case x :: xs => if (p(x)) x :: xs.filter(p) else xs.filter(p) 
		}
			
			
		def foldLeft[U](z: U)(op: (U, T) => U): U = this match {
			case Nil => z
			case x :: xs => (xs foldLeft op(z, x))(op)
		}
	}
