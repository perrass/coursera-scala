1.6 Collections
===

### Other collections

* **List** 
	+ Linear access of data
	+ Good for recursive operations
* **Vector**: The max number of pointers in vector is 32, If the number is larger than 32, the data should store as vector in a pointer in the main vector. And 32 pointers will be in a single cache line
	+ So the time of access is $log_{32}(N)$
	+ Good for bulk operations (批处理) that traverse a sequence
		+ Map: Traverse all elements
		+ Fold: Reduces addition elements with an operator
	+ x +: xs, create a new vector with leading element x, followed by all elements of xs
	+ x :+ xs, create a new vector with trailing element x, preceded by all elements of xs
* **Seq** is the base class of `List` and `Vector`
* **Iterable** is the base class of `Seq`, `Set`, `Map`
* **String**, **Array** are from Java universe
* **Range**: there are 3 key words: to, until, and by

	def isPrime(n: Int): Boolean = {
		val sqrtN = sqrt(n).asInstanceOf[Int]
		(2 until sqrtN) forall (d => u % d != 0)
	}

### Combinatorial Search and For-Expressions

**Nested Loops**

Given a positive integer n, find all pairs of positive i and j, with 1 <= j < i < n such that i + j is prime
