1.6 Collections
===

### Other collections

* **List** 
	+ Linear access of data
	+ Good for recursive operations
* **Vector**: The max number of pointers in vector is 32, If the number is larger than 32, the data should store as vector in a pointer in the main vector. And 32 pointers will be in a single cache line
	+ So the time of access is $log_{32}(N)$
	+ Good for bulk operations (批处理) that traverse a sequence
		+ Map: Traverse all elements
		+ Fold: Reduces addition elements with an operator
	+ x +: xs, create a new vector with leading element x, followed by all elements of xs
	+ x :+ xs, create a new vector with trailing element x, preceded by all elements of xs
* **Seq** is the base class of `List` and `Vector`
* **Iterable** is the base class of `Seq`, `Set`, `Map`
* **String**, **Array** are from Java universe
* **Range**: there are 3 key words: to, until, and by

	def isPrime(n: Int): Boolean = {
		val sqrtN = sqrt(n).asInstanceOf[Int]
		(2 until sqrtN) forall (d => u % d != 0)
	}

### Combinatorial Search and For-Expressions

**Nested Loops**

Given a positive integer n, find all pairs of positive i and j, with 1 <= j < i < n such that i + j is prime

1. Generate the sequence of all pairs of integers (i, j) `(1 until n) map (i => ((1 until i) map (j => (i, j)))`
2. flatten the Vector of Vector xss.flatten

A useful law:

	xs flatMap f = (xs map f).flatten

**For-expression**

	case class Person(name: String, age: Int)
	for (p <- persons if p.age > 20) yield p.name
	persons filter (p => p.age < 20) map (p => p.name)
	
Generally,

	for (s) yield e

where s is sequence of generators and filters

* A generator is of the form p <- e, where p is a pattern and e an expression whose value is a collection
* A filter is of the form if f where f is a boolean expression
* The sequence must start with a generator
* If there are several generators in the sequence, the last generators vary faster than the first
* {} can be used when multiple lines generators


	for {
		i <- until n
		j <- until i
		if isPrime(i + j)
	} yield isPrime(i + j)

### Combinatorial Search Example

**Set**

* `Sets` are unordered
* do not have duplicate elements
* fundamental operation on sets is contains

### Maps

* A map of type Map[Key, Value] is a data structure that associates keys of type key with values of type Value
* Class Map[Key, Value] also extends the function type Key => Value

Except for `Map("Key")` to get value, `Map get value` can also be used. The **type** of `get` methods are **`Option`**

	trait Option[+A]
	case class Some[+A](value: A) extends Option[A]
	object None extends Option[Nothing]
	
**Polynomial can be seen as a map**

$x^3 - 2x + 5$

	Map(0 -> 5, 1 -> -2, 3 -> 1)
	
So far, maps were partial functions: **Applying a map to key value in map(key) could lead to an exception, if the key was not stored in the map**

There is an operation `withDefaultValue` that turns a map into a total function
